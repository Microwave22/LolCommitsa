GitHub contribution filler
==========================

I never really liked the GitHub "Contributions" counter that every user has on their profile page, and which it is impossible to turn off, at the time of writing. While the underlying idea -- the positive reinforcement of continued work -- is certainly good enough, my main reason for disliking it is that the working schedule of the given developer becomes completely apparent. If you are on vacation, stressed and worn out, busy doing other things, etc., this is reflected immediately in the graph.

Optimally, IMHO, users would just be able to turn the thing off. Until then, this repository serves as a way to add a bunch of "fictional" commits.
